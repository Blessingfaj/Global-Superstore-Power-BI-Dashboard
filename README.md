## Analysis and Findings
**Top 3 Countries by Profit (2014):**  
 The United States, India, and China generated the highest profit in 2014. Within these countries, top products included Phones (Technology) and Chairs (Furniture). High-profit regions tend to have a strong technology market with low shipping costs.

**U.S. Subcategories with Highest Shipping Cost:**  
 Top 3 subcategories: Tables, Bookcases, and Copiers. These bulky items have higher delivery costs; optimizing logistics or using local suppliers could reduce expenses.

**Nigeria‚Äôs Profitability (2014):**  
 Nigeria recorded low profit in 2014 due to high average discounts (~20%) and high shipping costs. This indicates pricing and delivery inefficiencies rather than poor sales volume.

**Least Profitable Subcategory in Southeast Asia:**  
 The Tables subcategory recorded the lowest profitability in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and Indonesia. Recommendation: review pricing or discontinue bulky furniture lines in those markets.

**Least Profitable U.S. City:**  
 Philadelphia had the lowest average profit (excluding cities with fewer than 10 orders) due to heavy discounting and low sales on large furniture items.

**Most Profitable Subcategory in Australia:**  
 Copiers and Phones generated the highest average profit in Australia, suggesting a strong market for Technology products.

**Most Valuable Customers:**  
 Top 10 customers contributed over 25% of total profit, mainly purchasing Technology and Office Supplies. Implement loyalty and personalized promotions to retain them.
